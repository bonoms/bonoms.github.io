<p>There was a man on the floor in pain on the way to the other building, 70% of students that had time stopped to help, but only 30% of those who were in a hurry helped the man. Many stepped on him to give a speech on &ldquo;the Good Samaritan&rdquo;, a bit controversial.</p>
<h1 id="instant-karma">Instant karma</h1>
<p>This text talks about a man called Matt that on his commute to work in the underground he moved aside to let a woman to jump off the train before him, but a man pushed past her rudely. Later that day the same man arrive to Matt’s office, he recognized him and asked him a lot of questions about underground travel, when the man recognize Matt laughed, obviously the man did&rsquo;t got the job.</p>

<p>The first person says that he was in Iran, crossing the Persian Desert and it was very cold. He couldn’t feel his fingers because he was going on the scooter without gloves, and suddenly he saw that there was a car that stopped in front of him. The man driving the car got out and gave  his gloves to him. Unfortunately, he couldn’t speak English so he never said thank you to the person who probably saved his fingers.</p>
<p>The second person says that when she was coming back from South Africa in 2003, she had to take The Tube but she went to the station in the rush hour, so there were a lot of people. Because of them, she couldn’t see the train arriving, but fortunately two young girls helped her: they stood on top of a thing to see the train and they found a place to sit down on it, making somebody stand up. She would love to thank them now.</p>
<p>The third person says that about 30 years ago, he went shopping in oxford street with his wife and their two sons aged four and six years old. They were in the first floor looking for clothes in a clothes shop and found out that his four-year-old kid was missing. Then, he started searching him in the building and out in the street, but there were no sign of him. His wife, calmer than him, phoned the police station and they discovered that a woman had seen the boy crying on the pavement and made the decision to take him to the police station. Unfortunately, the family couldn’t say thank you to her because she didn’t left any name or address.</p>
<p>The last person says that she recently lost her purse in a bus, and two young girls claimed it. Her daughter, Tamsin, lost her purse like her mom but fortunately a kind person picked it up, found the address on the driving licence and put it in an envelope that was sent to her. She would love to be able to say thank you to that person who didn’t behave like the young girls.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of the internet, sharing was not secure and it wasn&rsquo;t handy, but now with the internet people can rent anything they use little. <strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Airbnb</strong> are the perfect examples, with Airbnb you can rent rooms that you don&rsquo;t use or the whole house, if, for example, you are by the sea, and you can also read the reviews of users, to trust more.</p>
<p>Also an increase in sharing offers economic benefits to both users and companies.</p>
<p>Sharing economy could bring a sense of community that has been lost over time.</p>
<p>Seoul is called the &ldquo;city of sharing&rdquo; because, for example, inside the flats there are libraries for residents and in this city people also lend cars or clothes each other.</p>
